CS 411 - Assignment 4
Mass Transit

The app behaves properly. All requirements were met.

The app has a bug where the map does not display the correct
location the first time a stop's detail view is loaded.

Added an extra view that displays the arrival times of the particular stop. This view needs more work. Currently, it displays all the stop times. In the future, it should also indicate if that stop time belongs to weekday, weekend, holiday, etc schedule.
